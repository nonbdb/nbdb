 * This class is heart of YouTrackDB storage model it presents disk backed data cache which works

 *
 * <p>Model of this cache is based on page model. All direct memory area is mapped to disk files
 * and each file is split on pages. Page is smallest unit of work. The amount of RAM which can be
 * used for data manipulation is limited so only a subset of data will be really loaded into RAM on
 * demand, if there is not enough RAM to store all data, part of them will by flushed to the disk.
 * If disk cache is closed all changes will be flushed to the disk.
