### What is YouTrackDB?
YouTrackDB is an object-oriented graph database that supports documents, full-text search, reactivity, and geospatial concepts. 

YouTrackDB's key features are:
1. **Fast data processing**: YouTrackDB process links traversal with O(1) complexity. No expensive run-time JOINs.
2. **Universal API**: YouTrackDB implements graph and object-oriented data models. It provides a rich entity processing API that works uniformly over all remote and embedded deployment environments.
3. **SQL-like query language**: YouTrackDB uses a dialect of SQL query language enriched by graph and object-oriented functions and commands. Thanks to the SQL layer, it's easy for people skilled in the relational world to use.
4. **Scalable development workflow**: YouTrackDB works in schema-less, schema-mixed, and schema-full modes. Universal API allows you to port your database to a server environment without changing your application code.
5. **Strong security**: YouTrackDB has a strong security profiling system based on user, role, and predicate security and supports SQL as a query language.
6. **Encryption of data at rest**: YouTrackDB optionally encrypts all data stored on disk using modern AES encryption.
7. **Binary compatibility with OrientDB**: Databases created with OrientDB can be used without any data alterations in YouTrackDB.
 
### Easy to install and use
YouTrackDB can run on any platform without configuration and installation.
The full Server distribution is a few MBs without the demo database.

### Skilled team of professionals
YouTrackDB is a binary compatible fork of OrientDB supported and evolved by [YouTrack](https://www.jetbrains.com/youtrack) project from JetBrains
