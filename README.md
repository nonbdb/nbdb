## What is YouTrackDB?

**YouTrackDB** is an Open Source Entity Store with the support of Native Graphs, 
Full-text search, Reactivity, Geo-Spatial, and Object Oriented concepts. 
It's written in Java and it's amazingly fast. 
No expensive run-time JOINs, connections are managed as persistent pointers between entities. 
You can traverse thousands of entities in no time. Supports schema-less, schema-full and schema-mixed modes.
Has a strong security profiling system based on user, roles and predicate security and 
supports SQL amongst the query languages. Thanks to the SQL layer 
it's straightforward to use for people skilled in the Relational world.

## Is YouTrackDB a Relational DBMS?

No. YouTrackDB adheres to the [NoSQL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL) movement even though it supports ACID Transactions 
and SQL as a query language. 
In this way, it's easy to start using it without having to learn too much new stuff. 

## Easy to install and use

Yes. YouTrackDB is totally written in [Java](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29) and can run on any platform without configuration and installation.
The full Server distribution is a few MBs without the demo database.
