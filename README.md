## What is OxygenDB?

**OxygenDB** is an Open Source Multi-Model [NoSQL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL) DBMS with the support of Native Graphs, 
Documents, Full-Text search, Reactivity, Geo-Spatial and Object Oriented concepts. 
It's written in Java and it's amazingly fast. 
No expensive run-time JOINs, connections are managed as persistent pointers between records. 
You can traverse thousands of records in no time. Supports schema-less, schema-full and schema-mixed modes.
Has a strong security profiling system based on user, roles and predicate security and 
supports SQL amongst the query languages. Thanks to the SQL layer 
it's straightforward to use for people skilled in the Relational world.

## Is OxygenDB a Relational DBMS?

No. OxygenDB adheres to the [NoSQL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL) movement even though it supports ACID Transactions 
and SQL as a query language. 
In this way, it's easy to start using it without having to learn too much new stuff. 

## Easy to install and use

Yes. OxygenDB is totally written in [Java](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29) and can run on any platform without configuration and installation.
The full Server distribution is a few MBs without the demo database.
